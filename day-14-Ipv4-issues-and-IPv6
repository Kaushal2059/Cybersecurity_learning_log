IPv4 Issues
	The Need for IPv6
	
	RIR IPv4 Exhaustion Dates:
		IPv4 has a theoretical maximum of 4.3 billion addresses and is running out of addresses.
		
		When the IETF began its development of a successor to IPv4, it used this opportunity to fix the limitations of IPv4 and include enhancements. 
		One example is Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6), which includes address resolution and address autoconfiguration not found in ICMP for IPv4 (ICMPv4).
				
	IPv4 and IPv6 Coexistence
		Migration techniques from IPv4 to IPv6:
			Dual stack:
				Dual stack allows IPv4 and IPv6 to coexist on the same network segment. Dual stack devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks simultaneously. 
				Known as native IPv6, this means the customer network has an IPv6 connection to their ISP and is able to access content found on the internet over IPv6.
			Tunneling:
				Tunneling is a method of transporting an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network. The IPv6 packet is encapsulated inside an IPv4 packet, similar to other types of data.
			Translation:
				Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64) allows IPv6-enabled devices to communicate with IPv4-enabled devices using a translation technique similar to NAT for IPv4. 
				An IPv6 packet is translated to an IPv4 packet and an IPv4 packet is translated to an IPv6 packet.
				
	IPv6 Addressing
		represented using hexadecimal number
		
	16-bit Segments or Hextets
		IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and written as a string of hexadecimal values. Every four bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit; for a total of 32 hexadecimal values. 
		IPv6 addresses are not case-sensitive and can be written in either lowercase or uppercase.
		the preferred format for writing an IPv6 address is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x
		Preferred format means that you write IPv6 address using all 32 hexadecimal digits.
		
	 IPv6 Formatting Rules
		There are two rules that can be used to reduce the hexadecimal number used to represent a hexadecimal number:
			Rule 1: Omit Leading 0s:
				example 0211:2ad2:0000:0000:0000:02db:2210:2dde can be written as 211:2ad2:0:0:0:2db:2210:2dde
			Rule 2: Double column
				0211:2ad2:0000:0000:0000:02db:2210:2dde 0211:2ad2::02db:2210:2dde
					Also 211:2ad2::2db:2210:2dde is correct when we combine both rules
			Note: the double column cannot be used more than once or else it will create ambiguity because of the ambiguity in the number of 0s. Best apply at the longest string.
