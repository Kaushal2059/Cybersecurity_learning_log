		It is most for a host to have a IPV4 adress to participate onn the internet and almost every LANs today.
		It must be uniquely configured.
		
	Octets and Dotted-Decimal Notation
		IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in length. Here is an IPv4 address in binary:
		11010001101001011100100000000001

		Which is very tough to read.For this reason, the 32 bits are grouped into four 8-bit bytes called octets like this:
		11010001.10100101.11001000.00000001

		That's still difficult to read. That's why we convert each octet into its decimal value, separated by a decimal point or period.
		The above binary IPv4 becomes this dotted-decimal representation:
		209.165.200.1
		
	The IPv4 Address Structure
		if 192.168.2.0 is the ip address 198.168.6 is the network component and 0 is the host
		Inside a network, each of the nodes needs to have the same network octate and the host part has to be unique
		
	With IPv4 addressing, multiple logical networks can exist on one physical network if the network portion of the logical network host addresses is different. 
	For example: three hosts on a single, physical local network have the same network portion of their IPv4 address (192.168.18) and three other hosts have 
	different network portions of their IPv4 addresses (192.168.5). The hosts with the same network number in their IPv4 addresses will be able to communicate
