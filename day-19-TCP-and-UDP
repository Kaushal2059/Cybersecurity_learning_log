TCP and UDP
		TCP and UDP operations (both operate at the transport layer)
			UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
			 -> Used in real time communication and streaming as it doesnot need acknowledgement for receiving messages
				There will be a large stream of bits while transporting data in the transport layer and it is divided into segments with each segment cotaining a source and destination port.
				If one packet gets dropped it doesnot create much impact and it would be more efficient to move forward rather than going back and retriving the packet in real time.
				This protocol is less reliable
			TCP
				Considering above case if the scenario is of Bank transfer even a small packet loss can create a significant impact
				-Eack TCP packet has a sequence number in addition to the destination and the host port numbers so the receiver receives and accounts for each one and once it receives all the packets,
				it will send an acknowledgement
				Constant communication is taken place between the end devices(sender and the receiver) as how many packets to be received between acknowledgement
				It is more reliable
