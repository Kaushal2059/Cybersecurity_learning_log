Network Boundaries:	
		Gateway to other networks:
			Gateway is a way for traffic to leave one local network and be floated to another remote network.
			If a computer need to communicate outside of the network that has to be done through a gateway. 
			
		Routers as Gateways:
			The router provides a gateway through which hosts on one network can communicate with hosts on different networks. 
			Each interface on a router is connected to a separate network.
			The IPv4 address assigned to the interface identifies which local network is connected directly to it.
			Each host must conatain a ipv4 address of router interface it is conneted to known as default gateway. 
		
		Routers as Boundaries Between Networks
			Most DHCP servers are configured to assign private addresses to the hosts on the internal network, rather than internet routable public addresses. 
			This ensures that, by default, the internal network is not directly accessible from the internet.
			Many ISPs also use DHCP servers to provide IPv4 addresses to the internet side of the wireless router installed at their customer sites. 
			The network assigned to the internet side of the wireless router is referred to as the external, or outside, network.
			
		 Network Address Translation(NAT)
			Introduction to NAT
				Used to convert private IP to public IP for communication between different hosts or networks in the internet
				The router keeps a table of private ip address with the public address.
					example:
					Private IP					Public IP
					192.168.1.2  -------------> 200.100.58.50
					192.168.2.5  -------------> 200.100.58.51
					
				If a packet has to be sent by 192.168.1.2 to a external server with ip 200.100.5.5
				When the packet is inside a private network, the packet looks like src - 192.168.1.2 and dest 200.100.5.5
				when it has to leave the private network it turns out as src - 200.100.58.50 and dest 200.100.5.5 as the router assigns with a stored registered public address
