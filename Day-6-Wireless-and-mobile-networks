Types of wireless networks:

Wi-Fi – enables devices like smartphones and laptops to connect to a network within the range of a wireless access point

GPS (Global Positioning System) – uses satellite signals to determine location with accuracy of up to a few meters

Bluetooth – low-power, shorter range wireless technology used for devices like headphones, speakers etc.

NFC (Near Field Communication) – very short-range communication used for services such as payments

Mobile device connectivity:

How mobile devices connect using Wi-Fi and wireless technologies to access networks and services

Building a home network:

Understanding the role of routers in connecting devices securely

Router ports:

Ethernet ports – connect wired devices within the home or small office

Internet (WAN) port – connects the router to the ISP via a modem.

This session highlighted how wireless technologies make connectivity convenient—but also why securing wireless and mobile networks is essential in cybersecurity.
